1. My Activities
   
I am a passionate community builder focused on connecting people and projects around emerging technologies, particularly in the fields of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. I organize online and in-person events that facilitate knowledge sharing, networking, and collaboration among developers, investors, and enthusiasts in these areas.
I have participated as an organizer in events such as:
Ethereum Bolivia 2023
Ethereum Bolivia 2024
Monthly Ethereum Bolivia Meetups throughout the year (2022-2024).
My social media platforms, where I usually post about my activities, are:

1.1 About the TechFusion Event
Event Objective
 We are very excited to organize this event with a new emerging community called ComunDAO3600, as we aim to become a DAO dedicated to supporting Bolivian projects. Our event, TechFusion, seeks to bring together hundreds of people interested in exploring synergies between AI and blockchain, fostering a continuous learning environment and business opportunities.
The goal is to gather students, experts, and entrepreneurs to explore the intersections between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and Cryptocurrencies. We aim to encourage hands-on learning, discussions about emerging innovations, and networking among participants.

2. Benefits for the DAO:
   
By involving the DAO in my activities, key opportunities will be created for:
Visibility and positioning: The DAO will be directly associated with events that highlight technological innovation, increasing its recognition within the crypto and blockchain ecosystem.
Talent attraction: Through conferences and workshops, we will attract developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs who can join the DAO as active members or collaborators.
Community expansion: These events will attract new users and participants who align with the DAO's values and objectives, creating a stronger user base.
Collaboration opportunities: The events will facilitate the creation of strategic partnerships with related projects and organizations.

3. Potential Risks for the DAO:
   
As with any growth initiative, there are certain risks, although I believe they are manageable:
Reputation: While I always strive to maintain high standards of quality in the events, there is a risk that a speaker or collaborator might not meet expectations, which could reflect negatively on the DAO. However, to mitigate this, I carefully select speakers and collaborators.
Low short-term return on investment: Tangible benefits, such as new collaborations or adoptions, may not be immediate, as building strong communities takes time.

4. Required Resources:
   
To carry out these events, I will need the following resources:
Marketing budget: To promote the event on social media, platforms, and other relevant channels.

Event platform: I use live streaming and conference management tools, so part of the budget will be allocated to these platforms.
Technical team: A small team to support technical aspects and event coordination.

5. Event Schedule:
    
TechFusion November 2024 (online): Event focused on the intersection of AI and Blockchain. (Dates: November 13 - 20).

TechFusion November 2024 (in-person): A more interactive event focusing on networking and knowledge sharing. (November 22, 2024).

Each event will feature industry leaders, networking opportunities, and chances for the DAO to showcase itself as a pioneer in the space.
